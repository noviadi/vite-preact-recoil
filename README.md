# vite-preact-recoil
Just for shits and giggles

Vite preact with aliased React

### Note
As per this code is written, the latest Recoil release still hasn't support ESM. Import workaround in `app.tsx` looks like shit.
The HMR will also generate warning in console for duplicated state and what not. But, it should be working.
